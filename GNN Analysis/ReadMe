# Venmo Data Analysis - Big Data Bandits

## Objective
This project analyzes Venmo transaction data using text analytics, social network analytics, predictive models, and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to uncover patterns and insights into user behavior.

---

## Part 1: Text Analytics
- **Goal:** Classify Venmo transactions based on description keywords and emojis.
- **Process:**
  - Loaded Venmo transaction data and applied classification using dictionaries.
  - Analyzed user spending patterns by aggregating classified transactions over a 12-month period.
  - Visualized spending trends across categories with confidence intervals.
- **Result:** Identified user spending behaviors across different categories over the first year.

## Part 2: Social Network Analytics
- **Assumptions:**
  - Transactions create undirected edges between users in a graph.
- **Metrics Calculated:**
  - **Number of Friends:** Direct connections between users.
  - **Friends of Friends:** Indirect connections in the network.
  - **Clustering Coefficient:** Measures network clustering for a user.
  - **PageRank:** Assesses user importance in the network.
- **Key Results:**
  - For user 1218774: 5 direct friends, 35 friends of friends, a clustering coefficient of 0.2, and a PageRank of 2.68e-07.

## Part 3: Predictive Analytics
- **Models:**
  - Recency-Frequency (RF) model
  - RF + Spending Behavior
  - Social Metrics
  - Social + Spending
- **Findings:**
  - Spending behavior improves predictions in early months.
  - Social network metrics require longer historical data for accurate predictions.

---

## Part 4: Graph Neural Networks (GNN)
- **Task:** Use GNNs to predict transaction patterns and user behavior.
- **Insights:**
  - GNNs capture both local and global graph structures, providing deeper insights than traditional feature engineering.
  - GNNs proved more efficient and scalable for graph-based data.

## Conclusion
The analysis demonstrated that combining social metrics and spending behavior enhances predictive power, with GNNs offering a robust, scalable approach for understanding complex transactional relationships.
